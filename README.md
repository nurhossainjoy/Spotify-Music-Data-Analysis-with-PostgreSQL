![Spotify_logo](https://github.com/nurhossainjoy/Spotify-Music-Data-Analysis-with-PostgreSQL/blob/main/Logo/Logo.png)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **SQL** can be used to analyze Spotify music data and generate meaningful business insights. Using **PostgreSQL**, the project answers a variety of real-world business questions by applying SQL concepts ranging from basic filtering and aggregation to advanced analytical techniques such as **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** and **Window Functions**.

The objective is to showcase practical SQL skills that are commonly required for **Business Analyst**, **Data Analyst**, and **Business Intelligence** roles.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze Spotify music streaming data using PostgreSQL.
- Explore track, artist, and album performance.
- Generate business insights from streaming and engagement metrics.
- Practice SQL concepts through real-world business scenarios.
- Build a professional SQL portfolio project.

# 🗄 Database Schema

The **Database Schema** provides a structured overview of the Spotify dataset used in this project. It illustrates the organization of the dataset and serves as a reference for understanding the available attributes before performing SQL analysis.

The dataset consists of a **single table (`spotify`)** containing multiple columns representing track information, streaming performance, engagement metrics, and audio characteristics.

The schema helps developers and analysts understand the structure of the dataset before writing SQL queries.

# 🔗 Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram

Although the dataset is stored as a single table, the ER Diagram provides a conceptual representation of how entities such as **Tracks**, **Artists**, and **Albums** are related.

This visualization improves data understanding and documents the logical relationships within the dataset.
